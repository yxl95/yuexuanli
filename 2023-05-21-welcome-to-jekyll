The early-life social experiences of an infant with the mother can cast profound and enduring effects on the developing brain. Social interactions with the dam result in sensory stimuli of the infant that shape the maturation of neural circuits. Yet, the neural substrates encoding the experiences of the infant with the dam remain largely unknown. In this project, we identify that somatostatin neurons in the zona incerta (ZISST neurons) respond to social interactions with the dam in infant mice.
