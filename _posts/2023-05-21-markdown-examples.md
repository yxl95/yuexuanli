## Code

Source code can be included by fencing the code with three backticks. Syntax highlighting works automatically when specifying the language after the backticks.

````
```javascript
function foo () {
    return "bar";
}
```
````

This would be rendered as:

```javascript
function foo () {
    return "bar";
}
```
