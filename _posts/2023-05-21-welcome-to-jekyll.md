Social interactions with the caregiver, particularly the mother, is a major aspect of early-life experiences. The caregiver provides the infant with critical resources such as nursing, thermoregulation, and safety. Human infants are programmed to emotionally attach to their mothers. The infant-mother bond provides a template for future socialization. However, disruptions in this bond, such as child abuse, can render the infant more vulnerable to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorder. As such, understanding how infants emotionally attach to their mothers is a fundamental and unsolved problem in developmental neuroscience. Consequently, investigating how disruptions to these mechanisms affect health is of great significance. My thesis work aims to determine how the early experience of the infant with the mother is integrated in the infant's brain.
